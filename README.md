# Bubble-Sort Algorithm

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.


## Working of this algorithm:
- Start iterating over the array, take two elements from the begining
- Check whether, they are in order or not. If not then swap them else leave them as they were. Do that again for the second and third Element

NOTE: Repeat the above steps (n-1) times

## Complexity:
- The complexity of bubble sort algorithms is O(n^2) in both worst and average cases.
- But because of the fact, we're shortening the amount of Elements after iterating through the list/array and putting the highest Element on the end it reduces the possible swap possibilities


## Advantages of Bubble-Sort:

- super easy to code and implement
- Inplace algorithm (Does not use temporary storage)

## Disadvantages of Bubble Sort:

- does not deal well with a list containing a huge number of Elements
- requires O(n^2) for every n number of elements to be sorted
